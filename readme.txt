Basically 2-3-4 tree is an application of tree data structure. 
In computer science, a 2–3–4 tree (also called a 2–4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries.
    -> a 2-node has one data element, and if internal has two child nodes.
    -> a 3-node has two data elements, and if internal has three child nodes.
    -> a 4-node has three data elements, and if internal has four child nodes.
our project contains whole implementation of 2-3-4 tree, searching, insertion and traversal of the tree.
